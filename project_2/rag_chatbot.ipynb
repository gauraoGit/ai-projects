    "In this project, we’ll use **Gemma 3* (1B), a small but capable open-weight model, and run it entirely on your local machine using Ollama. This means you won’t need API keys or internet access to generate responses once the model is downloaded.\n",

    "Ollama is a lightweight runtime for managing and serving open-weight LLMs locally. It provides:\n",

    "* A model registry and command-line tool** to pull, run, and manage models easily.\n",
    "* Support for a wide variety of models (e.g., Gemma, Llama, Mistral, Phi, etc.), making it ideal for experimentation.\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "ollama serve\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "ollama pull gemma3:1b\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This downloads the 1B version of Gemma 3, a compact model suitable for running on most modern laptops. Once downloaded, Ollama will automatically handle model loading and caching.\n",
